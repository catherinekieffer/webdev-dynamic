# About the project
This project features information on airlines, most notably information on incidents and accidents for airlines. 
This site contributes to the Common Good as a user can come to this site and learn about the safety of airlines and discern which airline they wish to use to fly. This is very important, as although some airlines are ver y cheap, they may have a high number of incidents and accidents. This website has all of the information in one place in a database so the viewer doesn't need to look up a bunch of articles to try to figure out which airlines is the safest.
