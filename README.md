# About the Project
This project features information on airlines, most notably information on incidents and accidents for airlines. 
This site contributes to the Common Good as a user can come to this site and learn about the safety of airlines and discern which airline they wish to use to fly. This is very important, as although some airlines are very cheap, they may have a high number of incidents and accidents. This website has all of the information in one place in a database so the viewer doesn't need to look up a bunch of articles to try to figure out which airlines is the safest. St. Thomas is commited to preserving the Dignity of human persons, and this website is just another example of an opportunity given to students to learn about something that will contribute to the safety of a human person. In today's day and age, money is often put over the dignity of persons, and in the case of airlines, many people choose dangerous airlines because they don't want to spend more on a safer one. This website aims at increasing awareness of these accidents to show users just how many people's lives have been damaged due to airlines incidents and thus encourage viewers to choose safer airlines.
