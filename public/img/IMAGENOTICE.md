# PLEASE NOTE
The pictures, names, and background information about these people in the leadership.html are NOT real.
The images were sourced from <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>,
 and the background information and names were all made up. <br>
<br>
The focus of this project was to develop a clean and functional site that works with the webserver and the database.<br>
Adding the made-up people only served to make the site and its content seem more realistic, nothing more.
